JIRA Clone is a web-based task management tool inspired by Atlassian's JIRA. It provides a simple and interactive Kanban-style board for users to create, manage, and track tasks. With drag-and-drop functionality, users can easily move tasks across different stages: "Planned," "In-Progress," and "Completed." This tool is designed to streamline task management, offering a user-friendly experience with essential features for organizing tasks.
